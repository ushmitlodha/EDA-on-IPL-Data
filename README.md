# EDA-on-IPL-Data

In this Project, I worked with the IPL Data from 2008 to 2019 and performed various EDA techniques and derived useful insights in Python using the Numpy, Pandas, Matplotib & Seaborn Libraries

Using EDA & Visualization, we tried to answer the following questions:
1) Total number of matches played in each season
2) Which team has won the most number of matches overall
3) How the team's decision to bowl or bat first affected the match result
4) What captains preferred more after winning the toss
5) Winner of each season from 2008 to 2019
6) Which was the best player of the winning team
7) How many trophies each team has won over the course of 10 years
8) Who was the man of the match in each season's final
9) which team has hit the most number of 4's over the course of 10 years
10) Which player has hit the most number of 4's over the course of 10 years
11) which team has hit the most number of 6's over the course of 10 years
12) Which player has hit the most number of 6's over the course of 10 years
13) Who is the leading run scorer combined of all the season's
14) Which batsman played the most number of matches
15) Who was the bowler who took the most number of wickets combined of all the seasons
